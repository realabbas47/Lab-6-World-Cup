Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
When the number of simulations are small, we can see that some teams with very low rating get to win

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: Simulations get good enough
after 10000 simulations.
